# ZSH terminal

This custom terminal is based on ZSH. The `install.sh` script will install:

* ZSH
* Oh My ZSH
* PowerLevel10k theme
* Pygmentize (for cat with syntax highlighting)

## Install

To install it, just run

```bash
bash install.sh
```

When asked for ZSH to be the main shell, say YES and then hit Ctrl + D to finish the installation.

Restart the terminal and you are done!
